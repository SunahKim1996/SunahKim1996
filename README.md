## Hello, Thank you for visiting my GitHub. 

I'm Kim Sun-ah, a Korean Unity developer.

Don't give in to failure, **explore to the end** and find a solution.
Not complacent in the present, studying constantly and growing **sustainedly.

Furthermore, I want to develop a game that provides users with a positive experience.
